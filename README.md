# bucket-list-project
As a user I canâ€¦
1.	Create my own bucket list item by inserting activity, image, complete by date, and location (TBD).
2.	I can see the total list of my bucket list items and by clicking on them, have them appear in the main area. There is a button that shows whether I have checked off my bucket list or not. 


Stretch goals --
- Random bucket list generator
- Search near me for for different activities 
-
