# bucket-list-project
-	Bucket List creator to help users create an aesthetically pleasing and easy to use bucket list to keep track of what they want to accomplish in life. 

As a user I canâ€¦

1.	Create my own bucket list item by inserting activity, image, complete by date, and location.
2.	I can see the total list of my bucket list items and by clicking on them, have them appear in the main area. There is a button that shows whether I have checked off my bucket list or not. 
3. There are inspiration pictures on the left curated by the websites database. 

## Installation 
``` npm install json-server
